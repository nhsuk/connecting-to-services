<h2>Treating stomach ache at home</h2>

<p>There are things you can do yourself to treat stomach ache.</p>

<p>Speak to a pharmacist about medicines that can help you, or get advice about:</P>
<ul>
  <li>feeling bloated (trapped wind)</li>
  <li><a href="//www.nhs.uk/conditions/Indigestion/Pages/Introduction.aspx">indigestion</a> (burning pain or discomfort after eating)</li>
  <li><a href="//www.nhs.uk/conditions/Constipation/Pages/Introduction.aspx">constipation</a> (can’t poo)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have vomiting and diarrhoea with your stomach ache, it should stop after a few days. Try to drink a lot of fluids to avoid dehydration.</p>

<p>Painkillers like paracetamol can help with your stomach ache but won’t stop any vomiting and diarrhoea. Find out more about <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/gastroenteritis/Pages/Introduction.aspx">treating vomiting and diarrhoea</a>.</p>
